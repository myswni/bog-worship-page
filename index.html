            <p>"Bog", or "holy grail doggy lord", as others call him, is a nonfictional character that graced the world with his holy presense. People bowed down to him, loved him, and gave him anything he asked. Bog was forevermove appreciated, his presense echoing into the chambers of the future, and people continued to hail Bog and his godly presense. Bog was the most important thing on Earth. Bog would come first in desires. Ahead of family, friends, money, and feet. Thousands, probably even millions of people, erected statues, created cults, and created religions based the ideals of Bog. Bog was the most important deity on Earth.</p>

            <h1>Why?</h1>
            <h2>​</h2>
            <p>Bog was everything. Bog was the holy lord of this world. Bog was god. Bog was life. What is life, without Bog? All hail Bog, lest you want to die. Bog is everything. Bog is the one and only true god. Bog knew everything. Bog WAS everything. Life is truly meaningless without Bog. I tried going 2 days without praising the holy lord Bog, and I developed 3 different addictions. I became an alcoholic, a smoker, and my life went downhill. My mom and my dad left me due to me not praising Bog. All hail bog. Bog is the true heaven. Bog is the true lord and savior of our lives. I love Bog. I NEED Bog. Bog is the only thing keeping me alive at this point. I have sold all my possesions in honor of Bog.</p>
